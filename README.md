# PCC: Point Cloud Compression Tools

An open-source implementation in **C/C++** of the point cloud compression method proposed by
J. Kammerl et al., “Real-time compression of point cloud streams,”
*2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)*, pp. 778–785.
[doi:10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224647](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224647)

This project is an **ongoing effort** to reimplement the original approach in C/C++, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of integration into modern applications.
Example usage of the project can be found [here (demo viewer)](https://quangnguyenlong.github.io/vvideojs) and [here (integration repo)](https://github.com/filrg/pcs).

Note: This is a work in progress and may not yet cover all features described in the original paper.
